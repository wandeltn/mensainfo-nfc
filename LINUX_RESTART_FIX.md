# Linux Restart Mechanism - Fix Summary

## Problem
On Linux systems, the server would not restart automatically after an update and threw the error:
```
"cannot access local variable sys where it is not associated with a value"
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The Linux restart section had two main issues:

1. **Local sys import scope issue**: The code was trying to `import sys` locally within the exception handling flow, causing a variable scoping error where `sys` was not accessible in all execution paths.

2. **Embedded Python code approach**: The Linux section was still using embedded multi-line Python code within shell scripts (similar to the original Windows issue), which can cause parsing and execution problems.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed sys Module Import Issue
- **Before**: Local `import sys` within the restart function caused scoping issues
- **After**: Removed local `import sys` since `sys` is already imported at the module level
- **Result**: Eliminates the "cannot access local variable sys" error

### 2. Unified Restart Script Approach
- **Before**: Linux used embedded Python code in shell scripts (`python3 -c "..."`)
- **After**: Linux now uses the same approach as Windows - separate Python script file
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates shell parsing issues with multi-line Python code
  - Consistent approach across all platforms
  - Easier to debug and maintain

### 3. Enhanced Shell Script Structure
- Created proper shell script with error handling using `$?` exit codes
- Added fallback execution path if port waiting fails
- Improved cross-platform compatibility

## Code Changes Made

### app.py - Linux Section Updates

1. **Port waiting approach**:
```python
# OLD: Embedded Python code
restart_script = f"""#!/bin/bash
python3 -c "
import socket
import time
# ... complex embedded code ...
"
"""

# NEW: Separate Python script
port_wait_script = "..."  # Clean Python script content
port_wait_script_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "port_wait_temp.py")
restart_script = f"""#!/bin/bash
"{python_executable}" "{port_wait_script_path}"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # ... start new instance ...
fi
"""
```

2. **sys module usage**:
```python
# OLD: Local import causing scoping issues
import sys
sys.exit(0)

# NEW: Use module-level import
sys.exit(0)  # sys already imported at top of file
```

3. **Cleanup enhancement**:
- Added `port_wait_temp.py` to the cleanup function
- Ensures all temporary files are removed properly

## Testing Results
✅ Cross-platform port waiting script test passes  
✅ No more sys variable scoping errors  
✅ Consistent behavior between Windows and Linux  
✅ Shell script parsing issues eliminated  

## Files Modified
- `app.py`: Fixed Linux restart mechanism with consistent approach
- Added comprehensive test scripts to verify functionality

## Key Benefits
1. **Error elimination**: Fixed the "cannot access local variable sys" error
2. **Consistency**: Both Windows and Linux now use the same reliable approach
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more debuggable code structure
4. **Reliability**: Reduced complexity and potential failure points

The Linux restart mechanism should now work reliably during auto-updates, matching the improved Windows functionality.
